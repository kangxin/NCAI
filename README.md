# ü§ñNeuro-Conceptual Artificial Intelligence: Integrating OPM with Deep Learning to Enhance Question Answering Quality (COLING2025)
---
Based on our Paper - "Neuro-Conceptual Artificial Intelligence: Integrating OPM with Deep Learning to Enhance Question Answering Quality"
## ‚ú®Introduction
We introduce Neuro-Conceptual Artificial Intelligence (NCAI, a specialization of the neuro-symbolic AI approach that integrates conceptual modeling using Object-Process Methodology (OPM) ISO 19450:2024 with deep learning to enhance question-answering quality.

By converting natural language text into OPM models using in-context learning, NCAI leverages the expressive power of OPM to represent complex processes and state changes that traditional triplet-based knowledge graphs cannot easily capture.

This rich structured knowledge representation improves reasoning transparency and answer accuracy in a question-answering system (OPM-QA).
