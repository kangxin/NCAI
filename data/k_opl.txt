1. Heuristic can be principle, rule of thumb or at one of five other states. State rule of thumb is initial. State principle is final.
2. Heuristic-to-priniciple Evolving changes Heuristic from rule of thumb to principle.
3. Systems Engineering Practitioner & Expert Group handles Heuristic-to-priniciple Evolving.
4. Heuristic-to-priniciple Evolving from SD zooms in SD1 into Initial Observing, Documenting & Sharing, Project Selecting, Testing & Refining, Pattern Emerging & Recognizing, Effectiveness Validating, Theoretical Baking, and Consensus Building, which occur in that time sequence.
5. Heuristic can be documented & shared, effectiveness validated, pattern recognized, principle, rule of thumb, tested & refined or theoretically backed. State rule of thumb is initial. State principle is final.
6. Systems Engineering Practitioner & Expert Group handles Heuristic-to-priniciple Evolving.
7. Documenting & Sharing changes Heuristic from rule of thumb to documented & shared.
8. Testing & Refining changes Heuristic from documented & shared to tested & refined.
9. Testing & Refining requires Project Set.
10. Pattern Emerging & Recognizing changes Heuristic from tested & refined to pattern recognized.
11. Pattern Emerging & Recognizing requires Project Set.
12. Effectiveness Validating changes Heuristic from pattern recognized to effectiveness validated.
13. Effectiveness Validating requires Project Set.
14. Theoretical Baking changes Heuristic from effectiveness validated to theoretically backed.
15. Consensus Building changes Heuristic from theoretically backed to principle.
16. Initial Observing changes Heuristic to state rule of thumb.
17. Project Selecting yields Project Set.
